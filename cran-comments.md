## Resubmissiont
   Invalid file names in inst/doc were generated from vignettes that start with a 01-, 02- etc.
   These have now been fixed and begin with a-, b-, c-, etc.


## Static vignettes
Due to the time it takes to run the vignettes, I've included
them as static vignettes.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.6.1
* local Windoze 10, R 3.6.1

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There were 3 NOTES:

*Version contains large components (2020.1.1)

  This is the 2020 release of the package.
 
*New maintainer:
    Carl J Schwarz <cschwarz.stat.sfu.ca@gmail.com>
  Old maintainer(s):
    Carl J Schwarz <cschwarz@stat.sfu.ca>
  Maintainer: 'Carl J Schwarz <cschwarz.stat.sfu.ca@gmail.com>'

I have retired from SFU and now use my gmail.address.

## Reverse dependencies
None.
