## Static vignettes
Due to the time it takes to run the vignettes, I've included
them as static vignettes.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.6.1
* local Windoze 10, R 3.6.1

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There were 3 NOTES:

*Version contains large components (2020.1.1)

  This is the 2020 release of the package.
 
*New maintainer:
    Carl J Schwarz <cschwarz.stat.sfu.ca@gmail.com>
  Old maintainer(s):
    Carl J Schwarz <cschwarz@stat.sfu.ca>
  Maintainer: 'Carl J Schwarz <cschwarz.stat.sfu.ca@gmail.com>'

I have retired from SFU and now use my gmail.address.

* excluding invalid files
Subdirectory 'inst/doc' contains invalid file names:
  ‘01-Diagonal-model.html.asis’
  ‘02-Diagonal-model-with-multiple-ages.html.asis’
  ‘03-Non-diagonal-model.html.asis’
  ‘04-Non-diagonal-with-fall-back-model.html.asis’
  ‘05-Bias-from-incomplete-sampling.html.asis’ ‘01-Diagonal-model.html’
  ‘02-Diagonal-model-with-multiple-ages.html’
  ‘03-Non-diagonal-model.html’
  ‘04-Non-diagonal-with-fall-back-model.html’
  ‘05-Bias-from-incomplete-sampling.html’
  
These were automatically created by the R.rsp::asis vignette builder, so I am unsure
on how to deal with this note.
 
## Reverse dependencies
None.
