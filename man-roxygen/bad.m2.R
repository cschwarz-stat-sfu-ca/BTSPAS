#' @param bad.m2 A numeric vector with elements belonging to \code{time}.  In
#' some cases, something goes wrong in the stratum, and the number of recovered
#' marked fish should be ignored. For example, poor handling is suspected to
#' induce handling induced mortality in the marked fish and so only very few
#' are recovered.  The values of \code{n1} and \code{m2} will be set to 0
#' for these strata.
